*********************************************************

Responsive FileManager for TinyMCE is a free open-source file manager made with the jQuery library, CSS3, PHP and HTML5 that offers a nice and elegant way to upload and insert files, images and videos with TinyMCE version 4.x.
You can also use it as a stand-alone file manager to manage and select files.
The script automatically creates thumbnails of images for the preview list.
It can be configured for automatic resizing of uploaded images or to automatically limit the size.
You can personalise the configuration for each folder.
You can set a subfolder as the root and change the configuration for each user, page or FileManager call.

! Installation
*********************************************************
1. Upload the 'filemanager' folder just outside of the tinyMCE 4 installaion
2. Create a folder for your uploaded files and give it write permission (755).
3. Open filemanager/config/config.php and edit the settings for base_url, upload_dir, type extensions allowed, max file size, permits etc
Save file.
4. Great! Your work is finished!

PS If you don't see the preview images you need to give write permission to the thumbs folder in filemanager/thumbs.
If you are updating from a previous version of FileManager delete the contents of thumbs folder; the script will automatically re-create the thumbnails.
!IMPORTANT: if you are using htaccess protection, make sure your $GLOBALS PHP_AUTH_USER/PHP_AUTH_USER are defined in your webserver config

USE AS TINYMCE 4 FILEMANGER

Settings of tinymce should be like this: (remember to add filemanager in plugins list)
tinymce.init({
    selector: "textarea",
    theme: "modern",
    width: 680,
    height: 300,
    plugins: [
         "advlist autolink link image lists charmap print preview hr anchor pagebreak",
         "searchreplace wordcount visualblocks visualchars code insertdatetime media nonbreaking",
         "table contextmenu directionality emoticons paste textcolor"
   ],
   external_plugins: { "filemanager" : "/path-to-tinymce-external_plugins/filemanager/plugin.min.js" },
   image_advtab: true,
   toolbar: "undo redo | bold italic underline | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | styleselect forecolor backcolor | link unlink anchor | image media | print preview code"
 }); 
You can pass subfolder and filemanager title on TinyMCE init.


USE AS STAND-ALONE FILE MANAGER

You can use normal pop-up, Bootstrap modal, iframe, FancyBox iframe, Lightbox iframe to open the FileManager with these paths:

Only open filemanager(type=0 and not set field_id): 
path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=0&fldr=

Select Image: (type=1 and set id of input text in field_id variable): 
path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=1&field_id=fieldID

Select Video: (type=3 and set id of input text in field_id variable): 
path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=3&field_id=fieldID

Select File: (type=2 and set id of input text in field_id variable): 
path to filemanager../filemanager/dialog.php?type=2&field_id=fieldID

Get Variables list
type: the type of filemanager (1:images files 2:all files 3:video files)
fldr: the folder where i enter (the root folder remains the same). default=""
lang: the language code (es: &lang=en_EN). default="en_EN"
subfolder: the subfolder use as root. default=""


If you want use popup add in the address &popup=1

In demo page i use FancyBox with this configuration:

    $('.iframe-btn').fancybox({	
	'width'		: 900,
	'height'	: 600,
	'type'		: 'iframe',
        'autoScale'    	: false
    });

and the button has this code to open FileManager:

<a href="filemanager/dialog.php?type=0" class="btn iframe-btn" type="button">Open Filemanager</a>

Remember to include FancyBox, file in head section:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.css" media="screen" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js"></script>

If you not use FancyBox,, you must change the function to close the windows after file selection in filemanager/js/include.js:

function close_window() {
    parent.$.fancybox.close();
}



SET SUBFOLDER AS ROOT

You can set a subfolder as root and change this parameter in tinymce init or in external-link  through the subfolder variables.
So you can have a root folder for every user or use.
Remember to create the subfolder in your source folder first :)

In tinymce editor you must set the variable
    subfolder:"folder",
while in external link you can add in get parameters
    &subfolder=folder

The best way is with the session variable $_SESSION["subfolder"] =

Folder Example:

root
- folder1
  - subfolder1
  - subfolder2
- folder2
  -subfolder3

User1 subfolder=""
View:
folder1
  - subfolder1
  - subfolder2
folder2
  -subfolder3

User 2 subfolder="folder1"
View:
subfolder1
subfolder2


CUSTOMISE CONFIGURATION FOR EACH FOLDER

In FileManager Version 7 you can customise the config.php for each folder. Simply create a .config file inside your desired folder, and add the php variables that you wish to change. (Don't change $current_path,$upload_dir,$base_url,$root variables). You can also include an HTML text file by simply inserting .config file: $folder_message="html message" inside the folder. You can use this to specify the restriction or image resize.

Remember that the configuration of one folder is reflected in all its subdirectories.

MULTI-USER USE
If you want use filemanager in a multiuser cms you can simply create a folder for each users and set the session variable ($_SESSION['subfolder']) with the name of the user folder
