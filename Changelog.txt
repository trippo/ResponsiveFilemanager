Responsive Filemanager Changelog 

|------------------------------|
|          RFM 9.4.1           |
|------------------------------|

Major:
- Security Access Keys
- More Tinymce settings
- Tinymce 3.* support
- Bugfixes

Detailed:
- Security Access Keys
	If 'USE_ACCESS_KEYS' are set to true only those will access RF whose url
	contains the access key (akey) like:
	<input type="button" href="../filemanager/dialog.php?akey=myPrivateKey">

	Allowed access keys are defined in the config as well.
	$access_keys must be an array so you can add multiple.
	Your access key should NEVER be 'key' and keep in mind they are CASE
	SENSITIVE!
	For recommended key generation read the comments in the config file.

	If there's no access key supplied with the url or it's not in the
	$access_key array you will get 'Access Denied' and you cannot continue.

	For tinymce a new variable was added: "filemanager_access_key"

	Tinymce config example:

	tinyinit
	...
	external_filemanager_path:"../filemanager",
	filemanager_access_key: "myPrivateKey",
	...

	This is a bit of additional security so no one can access your filesystem.

|------------------------------|
|          RFM 9.4.0           |
|------------------------------|

Major:
- Cut/copy/paste support
- Drag&drop support
- Few new icons
- Code refactor
- Bugfixes

Detailed:
- Cut/copy/paste
	You can configure the actions in config.php file and disable/ limit them if needed.
	When right clicking on a folder/file there will be options for copy and cut 
	(and paste if files on clipboard and righ clicked on a file)
	There's icon for paste to this dir and clear clipboard after the 'new dir' icons
	They will grey out if there's nothing on the clipboard.

- Drag&drop
	Now you can drag n drop files/folders to other folders 
	(this will overwrite existing files if encountered any!)

- Icons
	Added new icons for the new functions
	All are legit made by me or get from free icon sites

- Code Refator
	- Added bunch of comments and change a lot of codes.

	- Changed all $_SESSION vars to be in a separet array 
	eg.:$_SESSION["verify"] -> $_SESSION['RF']["verify"]
	So now there won't be any problem with big projecfts integrating RF

	- Added the lang file url to $_SESSION['RF']['language_file']
	Now it can be included easily

	- Added a lot of new lang. lines and feedback info
	New lines added to every language (in english) so translation can go smoothly
	(There are places where i added %s to lang lines which will be swapped with an action name
	, commented out what will be inserted at runtime)

	- Added timeout when closing upload tab


- Bugfixes
	- Corrected issue #69 Dropzone spritemap.png problem
	Now when loading a language it will search for the appropiate spritemaps.
	If none found will fallback to english
	All spritemaps should follow the language code naming eg:
	For hu_HU:
		spritemap_hu_HU.png
		spritemap@2x_hu_HU.png

	(might consider moving them in a separte folder in the future)

	- Fixed issue #71 The uploaded file exceeds the max size allowed
	Now when uploading it properly check for max post size
	It is dealt with in config.php after definning the max upload size and if it's bigger 
	than server's ini it will revert it back to it.
